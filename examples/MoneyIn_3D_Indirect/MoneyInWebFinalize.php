/**
 *      Case : This follows the MoneyInWebInit case : your customer has returned to your website or you have received a POST notification from Lemon Way. You now need to find out how the payment went.
 *      Steps :
 *          - GetMoneyInTransDetails
 *      Note :
 *          - In this example, we print data, but keep in mind that if you arrive here from the Lemon Way notification (with POST data), printing will be pointless. You can log data in a file instead.
 *          - You have defined 3 return urls (success, error, cancel), but it is still recommended to make this call in order to verify the information and to make sure the POST or GET data were not maliciously modified.
 *          - If the status is SUCCESS (3) or ERROR (4), then it's a final status, it won't change.
 *          - If the status is still PENDING (0), then the status can still change : it means your customer has cancelled the payment or returned to your website, or something else that made them arrive on one of your return urls, without finishing their payment. The customer will still be able to go back to the payment form using the browser's back button, and make the payment. You should either :
 *              - just like Lemon Way, not change the payment status and still give your customer the opportunity to pay
 *              - decide to mark the payment as failed on your side, but keep in mind that this won't prevent Lemon Way from accepting the payment if the customer pays.
